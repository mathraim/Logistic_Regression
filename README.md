# Logistic_Regression
Logistic Regression implemented from scratch on matlab

In this exercise, I implemented logistic regression from scratch and applied it to two different datasets. 

For the first dataset, suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. 
You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
Your would like to use my classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.

For the second dataset, suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. 
From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. 
Your would like to use my classification model in order to make a decision 

- **plotDecisionBoundary.m** contains function to plot classifier’s decision boundary
- **plotData.m** contains function to plot 2D classification data
- **sigmoid.m** contains implementation of the Sigmoid Function
- **costFunction.m** contains implementation of the Logistic Regression Cost Function
- **predict.m** contains implementation of Logistic Regression Prediction Function
- **costFunctionReg.m** contains implementation of Regularized Logistic Regression Cost
- **ex2.m** loads the dataset and combines all the function above to perform a logistic regression for the first dataset
- **ex2 reg.m** loads the dataset and combines all the function above to perform a logistic regression for the second dataset
- **ex2data1.txt** - first dataset
- **ex2data2.txt** - second dataset
